# Project Conventions

Define your project conventions here. This file is passed to the AI on each iteration.

## Build & Verify
**IMPORTANT**: Before marking any task complete, verify your changes compile/build:
```bash
# Add your build command here, e.g.:
# go build .
# npm run build
# cargo build
```
Do not mark a task complete if the code does not compile or tests fail.

## Code Style
- Language and version requirements
- Formatting rules
- Naming conventions

## Error Handling
- How to handle and report errors
- Logging conventions

## Testing
- Test file naming and commands
- Coverage requirements

## Git Commits
Use conventional commits format:
- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation only
- `refactor:` code restructuring
- `chore:` maintenance tasks
- `test:` adding or updating tests

Example: `feat: add user authentication endpoint`
